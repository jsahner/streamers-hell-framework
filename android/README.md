# Vibration

This project runs a vibration pattern on an Android device as a modification. By default, the Android device will connect to `192.168.1.101:61000`. Build it with Android Studio and **read the notice** below! 

## Notice

**TL;DR: This project is most definitely broken.**

This project was added by request after I handed in my thesis. 
It is an old, erroneous project that was used during a study that was part of my thesis, in which we evaluated an offline prototype of Streamer's Hell.
During that study, this code caused major connectivity issues and did not run as intended.
Probably because it was my first Android project whatsoever and I had no clue how to make it correctly work across different devices (at least the ones that were used in the study).
By request, I adapted this code to use the renewed API of SHF.
It is **untested and will probably not work** (as was arranged with the respective requester), but could potentially serve as a guideline for own implementations.
