# Tobii Trigger

This project exposes a single modification to simulate a key press of _CTRL+ALT+._, which can be set in [Tobii Ghost](https://gaming.tobii.com/software/ghost/) to toggle the visualizations on or off.

## Notice

This project was added by request after I handed in my thesis. 
It is an old project that was used during a study that was part of my thesis, in which we evaluated an offline prototype of Streamer's Hell. 
I merely adapted this code to use the renewed API, however, I cannot guarantee that it still works as expected. 
It may still serve as a guideline for own implementations.
